How old were you when you read it? You might not love it now.• Leta Hong Fincher writes about China’s push for educated women to have more children: “People aren’t responding to the new policy as the government had hoped.

It’s also a teaching tool about representation in media — a reminder to think more deeply about the stories we see and don’t see because of how cultural production continues to work, not just in the United States, but in Australia too.And after you see it, for a better understanding of what the movie means and why there is so much excitement about it, check out this story from The New York Times Magazine: Why ‘Black Panther’ Is a Defining Moment for Black America.Damien Cave is the new Australia bureau chief for The New York Times.
