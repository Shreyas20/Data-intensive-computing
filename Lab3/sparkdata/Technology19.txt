The mode allows up to 100 online players to battle each other to the death until only one player survives."We don't see it as a threat, we see it as an opportunity," COO and CFO Blake Jorgensen told Reuters when asked about "Fortnite"."Fortnite" has brought in younger players into the industry which is good for EA and other publishers in the long run, Jorgensen said.
