Allegations of ignoring sexual misconduct complaints.From the outset, it has been clear that Tuesday’s special election in New York’s 37th State Senate District is no ordinary contest; the race in Westchester County will help determine the balance of power in Albany.The intense scrutiny for a seemingly obscure seat is the result of a fragile deal that was recently brokered in which a group of breakaway Democrats who had long shared power with Senate Republicans agreed to return to the Democratic fold. That collaboration had helped give Republicans control of the Senate, despite Democrats holding a numerical majority, until early April, when the so-called Independent Democratic Conference agreed to return to the mainstream fold.The deal gave the Democrats a chance to sweep the Legislature and governor’s office. There was just one hitch: two Senate seats that had previously been occupied by Democrats will be decided on Tuesday in special elections.With such high stakes, the Democratic challenger, Shelley B. Mayer, an assemblywoman from Yonkers, is now engaged in a heated clash with Julie Killian, a moderate Republican and former councilwoman and deputy mayor in the City of Rye.That seat became available after its former occupant, George Latimer, a Democrat, won the race last year for Westchester County executive. The district was redrawn in 2012 by Senate Republicans to favor their party.In a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans by two-to-one, the presidency of Donald J. Trump has loomed large in the race. Ms. Mayer’s campaign is running ads in which Ms. Killian is made to look like a Trump clone. In an interview, Ms. Killian declined to address Mr. Trump’s record or rhetoric, saying she had been too focused on her race to follow the news out of Washington.“The perspective I want to bring to Albany is that of a mother, chemical engineer, finance person and community advocate involved in substance abuse and mental health issues,” she said. “It’s my on-the-ground experience that has shaped my views on the issues.”A mother of five, Ms. Killian, 57, studied engineering in college and, after earning a master’s in business, worked in finance. In 2012, she created a coalition to fight the opioid epidemic, which claimed the lives of several young people in Rye in recent years alone.At a time of national reckoning for women who were victims of sexual abuse, Ms. Killian’s campaign has sought to show that Ms. Mayer dropped the ball in addressing sexual misconduct complaints when, before running for the Assembly, she served as legal counsel to the Senate Democrats.According to a recent report in The Daily News, two women — one a former Senate staff member, the other still employed — said that in 2010, Ms. Mayer failed to help them when they alerted her to sexual harassment they had suffered at the hands of their bosses.In recent debates, Ms. Mayer, 64, acknowledged that she met with one of the women, and learned about the other incident through the woman’s boyfriend. She followed the protocol in place at the time, which was to refer allegations to the secretary of the Senate, a political appointee.“In both cases, I went to the secretary of the Senate and I made the case that they need to do more,” she said in a debate held in the studios of WRNN-TV on Tuesday. “They failed to do so. ”In an interview, Ms. Mayer said that the Assembly has a rule that requires mandatory reporting of any allegation of sexual misconduct to an outside law firm. “I believe the policy in the Senate was very flawed then, and the Senate Republicans just adopted it again,” she said.Ms. Killian has nonetheless seized on the report in an effort to cast doubt on Ms. Mayer’s feminist credentials. “She’s no champion of women,” Ms. Killian said. “She had the opportunity to help them. She was the most senior woman in the Senate Democrats at the time.”Some newly minted activists are not buying the portrayal. “There are two females in this race, but only one is pro-woman,” said Jenny Geer, who leads a progressive group called Blue Blast in Larchmont and Mamaroneck and who has canvassed for Ms. Mayer. “I think it’s convenient for Julie Killian to piggyback on the #MeToo movement and exploit it.”For her part, Ms. Mayer, who has championed legislation on gun safety, voting rights and redressing sexual abuse, expressed skepticism of Ms. Killian’s self-proclaimed centrist politics, saying she was trying to appeal to the county’s leftward tilt in the age of Trump. “I think she has become a moderate now,” she said. “She has not disavowed this president or anything he has done.”As evidence, Ms. Mayer pointed to one of Ms. Killian’s fund-raisers, Denise Ward, who in a Twitter post attacked a student activist from the high school in Florida that was the scene of the mass shooting in February. Ms. Ward called the student, David Hogg, “idiotic,” a “tool” and a “drone.” Ms. Killian rejected the comments and pledged to return the campaign money.Local Republican officials have embraced Ms. Killian’s candidacy, saying she had the knowledge and energy to capture a seat she had sought once before. In 2016, Ms. Killian lost to Mr. Latimer by more than 10,000 votes in the district, which covers about a third of Westchester, extending from Yonkers to the affluent town of Bedford.“It’s crucial for us in Westchester,” said Douglas A. Colety, chairman of the Westchester County Republican Committee, “and it’s crucial for control of the State Senate in Albany.”Advertisement
