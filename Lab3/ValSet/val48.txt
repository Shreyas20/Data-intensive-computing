Comey, kicking off a morning Twitter barrage by once again accusing Mr. Comey of leaking classified information and lying to cover it up, even as the leaders of North and South Korea held a historic meeting hours earlier.In a tweet, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey “either very sick or very dumb,” saying his fired F.B.I. chief did not understand the severity of his actions in having details about his interactions with the president provided to a reporter. “Remember sailor!” Mr. Trump added, a month after he pardoned a United States sailor who had pleaded guilty to illegally retaining national defense information and obstruction of justice.The sailor had taken cellphone photos in restricted areas on a nuclear submarine and destroyed them when he learned he was under investigation.Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!Fifteen minutes after he tweeted about Mr. Comey, the president turned to the news of the morning: He applauded the remarkable development on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim Jong-un became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea. “KOREAN WAR TO END!” he tweeted, a few minutes after saying that “good things are happening” on the Korean Peninsula, “but only time will tell!”Mr. Comey has been a favorite target of Mr. Trump’s in recent weeks as the former F.B.I. director has dominated news headlines while promoting a book he wrote about ethical leadership.Mr. Comey is not under federal investigation for leaking classified information or lying. The memos he kept about his interactions with the president are believed to be evidence in a possible obstruction of justice case against Mr. Trump being pursued by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey last May ultimately led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller.Republican lawmakers have said that light redactions made to Mr. Comey’s memos by the Justice Department before their public release this month are proof that he leaked classified information. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog is reviewing whether classified information in the memos was handled appropriately.In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Comey pushed back against the accusation that he had leaked classified information. “That memo was unclassified then, it’s still unclassified,” Mr. Comey said.Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump was the one who was making a “false statement.” He said: “He’s just wrong. Facts really do matter.”Conservatives have seized on one of Mr. Comey’s proclamations in a Jan. 28, 2017, memo in which he wrote: “I said I don’t do sneaky things. I don’t leak. I don’t do weasel moves.”In one of his memos, Mr. Comey described a conversation he had with Mr. Trump in which he told the president that leaks of classified information, specifically details of Mr. Trump’s conversations with foreign leaders, were “terrible.” Reports about Mr. Trump’s conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia roiled the White House during his first month in office.“I said they were classified and he needed to be able to speak to foreign leaders in confidence,” Mr. Comey wrote in a Feb. 14, 2017, memo. Mr. Comey added, “[NOTE: because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next].”Advertisement
