Comey in a series of tweets after details from Mr. Comey’s tell-all book were leaked before its official release.In the latest tirade, which unfolded over an hour, the president declared that Mr. Comey “will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” He mentioned Mr. Comey’s contemporaneous notes of their meetings, calling those memos self-serving and “fake.”I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!He again called Mr. Comey a “slimeball,” an insult he lobbed on Friday. He also questioned Mr. Comey’s intelligence twice — first by saying the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had been handled “stupidly” and then, about 30 minutes later, that Mr. Comey “is not smart!”Hours later, Mr. Comey appeared to make an indirect response to the jabs. In a post on Twitter, he said his book, “A Higher Loyalty,” was about “ethical leadership” and drew not only from his own life but also from “lessons I learned from others.”Of the three presidents mentioned in the book, two help illustrate “the values at the heart of ethical leadership,” Mr. Comey said, and one “serves as a counterpoint.”In his tirade, Mr. Trump questioned the integrity of former United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said in a recent interview with NBC News that she did not discuss Mrs. Clinton during her meeting with President Bill Clinton in June 2016 on a plane on an airport tarmac. Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server has long been the subject of controversy, and that meeting with Mr. Clinton cast a shadow over the federal investigation.Ms. Lynch told NBC that Mr. Clinton told a “charming story” about grandchildren and discussed issues of the day, such as Brexit.Mr. Trump balked at that description, writing on Twitter, “Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!”The president’s sharp remarks came hours ahead of Mr. Comey’s first major news media appearance since being fired by President Trump last year. Excerpts from the interview, which is set to air on ABC News on Sunday night, have been shared by the network after details from Mr. Comey’s book leaked on Thursday.Mr. Comey’s book describes Mr. Trump as “unethical, and untethered to truth” and compared Mr. Trump to a Mafia boss.[Read our review of Mr. Comey’s memoir.]The book also speculates about Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge Russia’s attempt to influence the election.“Maybe it was a contrarian streak,” Mr. Comey wrote, “or maybe it was something more complicated that explained his constant equivocation and apologies for Vladimir Putin.”On Friday, Mr. Trump and his allies counterattacked after the book excerpts leaked, and Democrats, many of whom blame Mr. Comey for Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election,  issued a muted defense.Mr. Trump continued his criticism of Mr. Comey’s book on Sunday, questioning why Mr. Comey had not used the book to address questions such as why “he gave up Classified Information.”Amid his tweets about Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump also addressed the latest military strike in Syria, defending his use of the phrase “mission accomplished” and saying the raid was “perfectly carried out.”Advertisement
