SYDNEY, Australia — President Trump has said he plans to nominate Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the commander of the United States Pacific Command and a vocal critic of China’s military expansion in the region, as ambassador to Australia.Admiral Harris, 61, who has spent 39 years in the Navy, is expected to easily win confirmation in the Senate.The United States has been without an ambassador to Australia, a major ally, since 2016. The alliance between the countries was strained in the early days of the Trump administration by an argument between President Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over the resettlement of refugees.As China flexes its might and North Korea speeds its nuclear program, a strong alliance between the United States and Australia is seen by many as crucial to maintaining the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.AdvertisementHere’s a look at the man who will most likely become central to that relationship.Born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an American father, he was the first Asian-American appointed to lead a combat command.AdvertisementAfter graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1978, he went on to become a naval flight officer and then earned a master’s degree in Asian security at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, another master’s at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown, and he attended Oxford.As head of the Pacific Command, he oversees about 375,000 military and civilian personnel, conducting operations in a region that spans more than 100 million square miles, or more than half of the earth’s surface.Last year, in two separate events, American warships under Admiral Harris’s command were damaged and several sailors were killed in collisions. He also  accepted full responsibility in April for a bewildering chain of events that mistakenly left the impression that the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson was rushing to confront an increasingly belligerent North Korea, when it was not.Appointed to lead the Pacific Command President Obama, Admiral Harris has taken a hard line against Chinese military action, calling Beijing’s policy to build bases in the South China Sea “provocative and expansionist.”He has described China’s efforts to build artificial islands in contested waters “a Great Wall of sand.” Since his appointment, he has advocated actively patrolling the South China Sea in so-called freedom of navigation operations.As much as Admiral Harris has warned of Chinese aggression, he has made clear that he believes the biggest threat to the region is North Korea.What you need to know to start your day in Australia, delivered to your inbox.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Australia increasingly finds itself economically dependent on China, its largest trade partner, even as some politicians have warned that the rising Asian power is trying to influence Australian politics.“What he needs to be aware of is the sensitivity around looking like Australia is doing America’s bidding,” said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute.Already, China has signaled concern about Admiral Harris’s potential new position.Though Chinese officials have not commented on news of the nomination, the state news media reported on Friday that a “U.S. hawk is made ambassador to Australia.”Follow Jacqueline Williams on Twitter: @jwilliamsNYT.Want more Australia coverage and discussion?
