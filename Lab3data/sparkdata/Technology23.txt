Fitbit said it expects current-quarter revenue to be in a range of $275 million to $295 million, below analysts' estimate of $309.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's net loss widened to $80.9 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $60.1 million, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of 17 cents, smaller than estimate of 19 cents. Revenue fell 17 percent to $247.9 million, but topped estimate of $247.3 million.
