Bright and early on Wednesday, Mr. Trump took aim at the Democratic nominee for governor, Richard Cordray, a bête noire of Washington Republicans for his past leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Congratulating Mike DeWine, the Republican nominee who will face Mr. Cordray, the president wrote in a tweet, “His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job!”As the races proceed, surrogates for Mr. Cordray like Senator Elizabeth Warren are likely to take hammer and tongs to the president to rally the Democratic base.For his part, Mr. Cordray wants to focus on “kitchen-table issues that Ohioans tell us are most on their minds,” he said in an interview at his campaign office, where he lounged in socks but no shoes.In an interview, Mr. DeWine rebuffed the suggestion of an impending Democratic surge.“Ohio is always a competitive state, but this idea of this big blue wave that’s rolling through the country certainly missed Ohio last night,” he said, pointing out that more voters turned out for him on Tuesday than for Mr. Cordray. He received roughly 495,000 votes compared with the roughly 423,000 Mr. Cordray received, according to election night figures.Democratic leaders may not admit to seeking a “referendum” on the president in states where he remains popular. Yet, they know that is precisely what has driven the Democratic base to turn out strongly in earlier contests n the past year in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, where Democrats made unexpected gains.The country’s next high-profile special election is in August for an open House seat near Columbus, Ohio. Once a solidly Republican seat in a district Mr. Trump carried easily, the race is now a tossup, according to nonpartisan analysts, thanks to an energized Democratic base. The candidates were finalized on Tuesday: Danny O’Connor, a Democratic official in Franklin County, will oppose Troy Balderson, a Republican state senator.In the United States Senate race, Ohio Republicans chose Representative James B. Renacci to try to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown, whose old-school progressivism — opposing trade deals, championing labor — aligns with part of Mr. Trump’s blue-collar appeal.“My message is consistent and will continue to be — I’m going to fight for the little guy regardless of whether she works in an office or works in a diner,” Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview. He suggested he would not make a point of going after Mr. Trump.“I will do what I do,” he said. “I don’t have this grand strategy. I think if you do this job the way you should, elections largely take care of themselves.”In Indiana, Senator Joe Donnelly, one of the most vulnerable Democrats, noted that he had voted with Mr. Trump 62 percent of the time in the Senate and had backed 70 percent of the president’s nominees.“If President Trump is right on an issue, I will be with him every time,” Mr. Donnelly said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday night. “When he’s not, I will pass. My job is not to be a cheerleader for the president, my job is not to be a cheerleader for a party leader or a party.”Mr. Donnelly is matched against Mike Braun, a wealthy businessman who ran as a political outsider, and who Republicans believe will serve as validation of Mr. Trump’s policies and anti-Washington appeal.“This will be the ratification of Donald Trump,” said Robert T. Grand, a lawyer in Indianapolis and one of the state’s most prominent Republicans. “Everybody says Donald Trump is in trouble. This will say maybe not.”Mr. Manchin, who has long found a way to win in West Virginia by creating a Democratic identity apart from the national party, faces perhaps the toughest race of his life in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 40 percentage points. His opponent, Mr. Morrisey, said on election night, “When President Trump needed Joe Manchin’s help on so many issues, Senator Manchin said, ‘No.’”He mentioned the Republican tax cuts, repeal of the Affordable Care Act and judicial picks.Mr. Manchin can be expected to play up his folksy manner — not long ago he publicized a visit to a Washington restaurant serving pepperoni rolls, a West Virginia specialty — and to attack Mr. Morrisey as a transplant from New Jersey who was born in Brooklyn.Sherry Mollett, 71, from rural Boone County in the southern West Virginia coal country, represents the voters whose support Mr. Manchin needs to lock down. Historically a Democrat, she voted for Mr. Trump two years ago. “I felt in my heart that he might help Boone County bring in jobs and make America great again,” Ms. Mollett said.On Tuesday she cast an ambivalent vote for Mr. Manchin. “I think he loves West Virginia,” she said. “I don’t think he’s done a whole lot up in Washington. I’m still waiting for more from him. He better get busy or I won’t vote for him the next time he runs.”Michael Tackett contributed reporting from Indianapolis.Advertisement
