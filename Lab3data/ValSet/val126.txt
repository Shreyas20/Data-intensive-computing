Bolton went to work as national security adviser, he began shaking up the Trump administration’s national security ranks, ousting President Trump’s chief adviser on homeland security, Thomas P. Bossert.Mr. Bossert’s sudden departure on Tuesday was the latest in an exodus of senior officials, and it leaves the White House short-handed in counterterrorism and cybersecurity operations as the president moves closer to a military strike on Syria.But it confirms that Mr. Bolton, a hard-line former ambassador to the United Nations, is determined to put his own stamp on the National Security Council. He also moved some of Mr. Bossert’s duties directly under the council, according to administration officials.While Mr. Bolton was widely expected to clean house, Mr. Bossert’s ouster came as a surprise — at least to him. On Sunday, he stoutly defended Mr. Trump’s immigration policies on the ABC program “This Week,” then traveled to a conference in Sea Island, Ga., where he gave a spirited defense of the way the White House makes policy.In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president thanked Mr. Bossert, 43, “for his patriotic service.”“The president is grateful for Tom’s commitment to the safety and security of our great country,” Ms. Sanders said. “Tom led the White House’s efforts to protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyberdefenses and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters.”A lawyer who had served in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Bossert made a name for himself as the public face of the White House response to hurricanes that tore through Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. His briefings, lucid and laden with statistics, were a counterpoint to the chaos that was seen as pervading other parts of the White House.But administration officials said Mr. Bossert chafed at that part of his job, preferring to get involved in higher-level policy issues on counterterrorism and cyberwarfare. Mr. Bossert, they said, aspired to a broader portfolio — even that of national security adviser — which was not in the cards.“You won’t believe this, but this White House seems to function just about the same as every other White House,” he said at the conference in Georgia. “At the end of the day, the only thing that creates instability or the perception of it is, A, the coverage, and B, the turnover.” Mr. Bossert spoke extensively about his plans for the coming year.Some colleagues viewed him as highhanded and faulted his handling of cybersecurity issues for being plodding and overly cautious. Others said he recognized the legal complexities raised by offensive cyberoperations, and was determined to conduct a thorough policy process before making decisions.Still, Mr. Bossert was one of the few high-ranking figures in Mr. Trump’s White House who had won bipartisan praise.Some resigned, others were forced out or fired.“Tom’s departure is a loss for this administration,” said Jeh Johnson, who was secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama. “I met him during the transition and was impressed. He struck me as a conscientious, levelheaded public servant.”While Mr. Bossert is known more as a technocrat than an ideologue, he became one of Mr. Trump’s most enthusiastic public defenders, sometimes to the discomfort of his friends from the Bush administration.He dismissed the president’s pardon of Joe Arpaio, the divisive former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona, as “pretty straightforward.” He said after Mr. Trump’s equivocal response to the white supremacist march and clashes in Charlottesville, Va., “I’m proud of the fact that he stood up and calmly looked into the camera and condemned this violence and bigotry in all its forms.”Mr. Bossert also came to the president’s defense last year when the government’s hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico came under withering criticism for leaving large parts of the island without power, weeks after the storm.“I don’t accept that we’re doing anything short of everything we can do,” he said to CNN, but added, “I do accept that there’s going to be a difference between a full-throated, adequate response and the complete satisfaction of bringing that entire territory back to its full, functional state.”By all accounts, Mr. Bossert got along well with Mr. Trump, who praised his handling of natural disasters. He also developed close ties to Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, with whom he traveled to Iraq, and with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser.But Mr. Bossert, officials said, had an extremely strained relationship with Mr. Bolton’s predecessor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and clashed with Kirstjen Nielsen, who served as a deputy to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, before becoming the secretary of homeland security.Mr. Bolton, an official said, has moved the counterterrorism and cybersecurity portfolios under the National Security Council. Rob Joyce, the cybersecurity coordinator on the council, who was Mr. Bossert’s deputy, will take his place on an acting basis.Mr. Joyce, a veteran of the National Security Agency, until last year ran the Tailored Access Operations unit, the nation’s premier group of hackers, which breaks into foreign government computer networks.Some former officials worried that the change would downgrade the job, which was created after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. “This is a vitally important position that should be a direct report to the president,” said Lisa Monaco, who served as homeland security adviser under Mr. Obama.Mr. Bossert stirred controversy during a recent meeting with members of the families of Americans who were detained and beheaded in Syria by Islamic State terrorists. He told them he hoped the United States would send two men recently captured in Syria, and suspected of imprisoning the Americans, to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.That rankled some family members, who recently published an Op-Ed in The New York Times calling for these suspects to be given criminal trials in the United States or The Hague.Mr. Bolton has yet to announce a major new appointment to the National Security Council. But he is making changes on multiple fronts. The day before Mr. Bolton took office, the director of strategic communications, Michael Anton, resigned under pressure.Adam Goldman, David E.
